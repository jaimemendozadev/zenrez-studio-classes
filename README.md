## Initial Setup

Open up your terminal and clone the repo locally to your computer by running the following command at the target destination: `$ git clone https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/zenrez-studio-classes.git`


## Starting the App

In the root of the app, use your terminal to run `$ npm install` to install all the app dependencies. Wait until everything finishes loading.

Open a second tab in your terminal and run the command `$ npm run build` to build all the React components. Watch the terminal and wait until all the components finish building.

Finally in the first terminal tab, or in another opened terminal tab, run the command `$ npm start` to start the app.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your favorite browser to start using the app.
